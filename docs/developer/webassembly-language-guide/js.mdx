# JavaScript WebAssembly Components

There are several different ways to build from JS/TS languages to WebAssembly.
This section will cover building with upstream tooling from the Bytecode Alliance.

`jco` AKA the JavaScript COmponent tool is a fully native JS tool for working with the emerging WebAssembly Components specification in JavaScript.

## Installation

Prerequisite tools for building WebAssembly Components from JavaScript/TypeScript source:

```bash
npm install @bytecodealliance/jco
npm install @bytecodealliance/componentize-js
```

## Usage

There are two main functions of `jco` that concern most wasmCloud users. 

1. Building a WebAssembly Component from JavaScript/TypeScript source

```bash
jco componentize [options] <js-source>
```

For example:
```bash
jco componentize app.js --wit wit -n world-name -o component.wasm
```

### How it works

componentize-js is an ESM (EcmaScript Module) to WebAssembly Component creator, via embedding the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine into the component.

> As a dynamic language with quirks, JavaScript cannot be compiled directly into bytecode without including a comprehensive ECMA-262 spec-compliant runtime engine. Componentization of JavaScript thus involves embedding the JS runtime engine into the component itself.
> [componentize-js](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js)

### Example


`package.json`

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@bytecodealliance/jco": "*",
    "@bytecodealliance/componentize-js": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node componentize.js && cargo build --release",
    "test": "./target/release/wasmtime-test"
  }
}
```

## Commands

### Build

```bash
jco build
```

### Test

```bash
jco test
```

### Publish

```bash
jco publish
```

### Clean

```bash
jco clean
```

### Help

```bash
jco help
```
